# UkraineMap App

This project is a web application that has two pages: a posts page and a map of Ukraine page. 

The posts page includes pagination, comments, and a statistics feature that displays the number of characters in a user's email address in a pop-up. 

The map of Ukraine page is a zoomed-in map of Ukraine that allows users to create markers with names (also in a pop-up), which are stored in local storage.
